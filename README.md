This project is done as part of the course Getting and Cleaning Data from Johns Hopkins University and is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

To carry out the operation set out by the program run_analysis.R there are a few conditions that have to be met:

1. Download the complete set of data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the files in R working directory.

Then you can run the run_analysis.R file to perform the analysis.

The output of the data is in the file averages.txt in the working directory
